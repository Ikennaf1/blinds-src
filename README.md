## About Blinds

Blinds is a Javascript script used to easily add dark mode styles to a website. We believe giving users the option for dark mode is no longer negotiable, and this applies to every type of website, and to every niche. Laravel takes the pain out of development by making the process as easy and intuitive as possile. Some of the features include:

- Simple plug and play script, with minimum required tweaks.
- Fast, yet powerful design features that works great for both tech-savvy and ordinary users.
- Ease of customization. You can customize anything, from Icons to stylesheets.

Blinds is accessible, intuitive, and provides easy way to make a dark mode version for your website's user interface.
